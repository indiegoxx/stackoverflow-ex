# Stack Overflow Answers Clone (Work in Progress)

This project aims to replicate a single Stack Overflow question page, allowing users to search for questions and view answers. It also integrates an AI-powered re-ranking of answers for improved relevance.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** Built with React
- **Backend:** Handles API interactions and LLM processing, likely using C# and .NET
- **External API:** Fetches answers from api.stackexchange.com
- **AI Re-ranking:** Utilizes the locally deployed Qwen:0.5b model
- **Containerization:** The entire setup will be managed via Docker

*More details, including full running instructions, will be added as development progresses.*
